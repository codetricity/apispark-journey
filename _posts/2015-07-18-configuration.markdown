In order to learn more about [APISpark]:http://restlet.com/products/apispark/ I've decided to write a short-lived blog about the journey and hopefully host the blog itself on
APISpark. As I'm using Jekyll, this may not work.

To write the blog, I'm using Komodo IDE 9.1 with Markdown language support and preview.  I think that Markdown is also available with Komodo Edit.

The publishing system is Jekyll on GitHub Pages.  I'm running Jekyll in a VirtualBox 5.0 VM running Ubuntu 15.04 on my host machine.
